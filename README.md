# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains two files in addition to this README file:
* An R Script that downloads and converts the data set for the course project into readable data frames. The code is explained in its comments. This one script does all the work required for the assignment. It will write two files:
1. The tidy data set produced in steps 1-4 of the assignment called tidy_data_simple.txt
2. The tidy data set produced in step 5 of the assignment called tidy_data_means.txt
* The corresponding codebook explaining the variables and what the script does.

For further info please consult the code book.
